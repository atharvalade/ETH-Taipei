We are going to build a back-end of a platform called as Authentica:

Verification Marketplace:
Providers come and list their proprietary algorithms through APIs for verifying AI generated content 
Authentica automatically generates an accuracy score based on data set, executing smart contracts to judge/assess the model 
Payment will be done in crypto to pay for each verification request through Authentica
NFT will be minted for human written content, if confidence score > 95%
Providers can compete


This is how the tech stack will work:

The app will be executed/marketed as a ‘world chain (world.org)’ mini-app. The mini-app shall basically be the verification marketplace for several providers. 
Once an user is onboarded on ‘world’, the user can come to submit text to query using a provider out of several listed providers.
Once the user selects a provider:
World Chain - The user will have to pay for the verification service either in USDC or WRD (world token). In this case, the smart contract is executed on the World chain.
The user will perhaps also have the option to pay using BTC. In which case a Solidity smart contract is executed on the Rootstock network using Hyperlane (bridge). 
Once the outcome is determined through the smart contract execution, the user will have an option to mint a NFT if the content is deemed to be human written to be able to flaunt on social media. Media houses can display the NFTs on blogs, news articles or students can use this to prove human written content. 

Addition - implementing a DAO structure to maximize web3 principles:
Issue governance tokens to providers based on their volume/accuracy
Implement on-chain voting for platform decisions (fee structures, accuracy thresholds)
Require providers to stake tokens as collateral ensuring quality service
Create a transparent treasury system for fee distribution
